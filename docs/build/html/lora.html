<h2>What is it?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>LoRa (Long Range) is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology. It is based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology.[1][2] It was developed by Cycleo of Grenoble, France and acquired by Semtech the founding member of the LoRa Alliance.</p>
<p>LoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and system architecture for the network, while the LoRa physical layer enables the long-range communication link. LoRaWAN is also responsible for managing the communication frequencies, data rate, and power for all devices.Devices in the network are asynchronous and transmit when they have data available to send. Data transmitted by an end-node device is received by multiple gateways, which forward the data packets to a centralized network server. The network server filters duplicate packets, performs security checks, and manages the network. Data is then forwarded to application servers. The technology shows high reliability for the moderate load, however, it has some performance issues related to sending acknowledgements.</p>

<h2>Features of LORA<a class="headerlink" href="#features-of-lora" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>LoRa uses license-free sub-gigahertz radio frequency bands like 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (Australia and North America) and 923 MHz (Asia). LoRa enables long-range transmissions (more than 10 km in rural areas) with low power consumption.[4] The technology covers the physical layer, while other technologies and protocols such as LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) cover the upper layers.</p></li>
<li><p>In January 2018, new LoRa chipsets were announced, with reduced power consumption, increased transmission power, and reduced size compared to older generation.</p></li>
<li><p>LoRa devices have geolocation capabilities used for triangulating positions of devices via timestamps from gateways.</p></li>
<li><p>LoRa and LoRaWAN permit long-range connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in different types of industries.</p></li>

<h2>Classes of LORA<a class="headerlink" href="#classes-of-lora" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Class A - Lowest power, bi-directional end-devices:</strong>
The default class which must be supported by all LoRaWAN end-devices, class A communication is always initiated by the end-device and is fully asynchronous. Each uplink transmission can be sent at any time and is followed by two short downlink windows, giving the opportunity for bi-directional communication, or network control commands if needed. This is an ALOHA type of  protocol.
The end-device is able to enter low-power sleep mode for as long as defined by its own application: there is no network requirement for periodic wake-ups. This makes class A the lowest power operating mode, while still allowing uplink communication at any time.
Because downlink communication must always follow an uplink transmission with a schedule defined by the end-device application, downlink communication must be buffered at the network server until the next uplink event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Class B – Bi-directional end-devices with deterministic downlink latency:</strong>
In addition to the class A initiated receive windows, class B devices are synchronised to the network using periodic beacons, and open downlink ‘ping slots’ at scheduled times. This provides the network the ability to send downlink communications with a deterministic latency, but at the expense of some additional power consumption in the end-device. The latency is programmable up to 128 seconds to suit different applications, and the additional power consumption is low enough to still be valid for battery powered applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Class C – Lowest latency, bi-directional end-devices:</strong>
In addition to the class A structure of uplink followed by two downlink windows, class C further reduces latency on the downlink by keeping the receiver of the end-device open at all times that the device is not transmitting (half duplex). Based on this, the network server can initiate a downlink transmission at any time on the assumption that the end-device receiver is open, so no latency. The compromise is the power drain of the receiver (up to ~50mW) and so class C is suitable for applications where continuous power is available.
For battery powered devices, temporary mode switching between classes A &amp; C is possible, and is useful for intermittent tasks such as firmware over-the-air updates.</p></li>

<h2>What is LoRa Gateway?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-lora-gateway" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>LoRa gateway is a sophisticated software architecture designed to carry out communication in LoRa network terminology. It acts as a smart hub between end devices and application network server. In future, it will be preinstalled on all IoT enabled hardware to support wide range of applications.</p>
